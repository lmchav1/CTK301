                <p>Hello! I am Luz Chavez. I am currently 20 years old and attending Illinois State University. I am majoring in Game Design and am expected to graduate in 2026. I spend a lot of my time watching movies or shows but if I am not bingewatching I am doing art! My main forms of media are digital or traditional. I specialize in original character artwork or work for social media. My hope in the Game Design field is to work on character design or the storytelling aspect of games.<br></p>
                
                <p>About my gallery: Here I have pulled works from my Instagram <a href="https://www.instagram.com/kyuu.draws/" target="_blank">(@kyuu.draws)</a> and some pieces I had done digitally on my Ipad on Procreate. Most of these are just character drawings, of no one in particular, mainly just characters I have just randomly drawn and come up with. There is no plan when I go into drawing, I begin by figuring out a pose first and then add pieces that I think fit and belong and once I see a clearer image I refine it to its final piece. I always try to make sure my pieces have some sort of story or at least emotion. In the end, my art is more for my own pleasure, but I love to share it with others if possible.</p>
